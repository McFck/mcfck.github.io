# Personal site pet-project
This is just for fun small project to keep track of recently watched anime/manga/movies(WIP), created using **Angular** and some UI libraries (like **Angular Material**, **NgBootstrap** and **HighCharts**). Basic stuff like localization, time calculation and other are done with selfwritten logic, to minimize external dependecies. 

## Used mat libraries:
- https://ng-bootstrap.github.io
- https://material.angular.io
- https://icons.getbootstrap.com
## Color matching:
- https://mycolor.space/
