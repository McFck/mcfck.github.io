# Personal site pet-project
This is just for fun small project to keep track of recently watched anime/manga/movies(WIP), created using **Angular** and some UI libraries (like **Angular Material**, **NgBootstrap** and **HighCharts**). Basic stuff like localization, time calculation and other are done with selfwritten logic, to minimize external dependecies. 

*This project also covers some some sketchy markup/styling problems. For example: animated background in rounded div. For some reason youtube still have some problems with this concept.*

## Used mat libraries:
